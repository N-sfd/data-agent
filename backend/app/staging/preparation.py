"""Staging preparation for one extracted document: pin the staging profile,
then build the schema-neutral source structure only if that profile — or
an uncertain resolution — calls for it.

    resolve profile (text + V3 signals; no structure needed)
        → profile.source_structure == "required"        → build structure
        → "optional" and resolution not confident         → build structure
          (the document may really be generic; never skip into an empty
          Generic workbook)
        → otherwise                                        → skip

Anything that needs the structure later (the Generic adapter, the
source-structure endpoints) builds it on demand, so a skip never removes
the capability — it only avoids paying for it up front.
