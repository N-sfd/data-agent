"""Staging profile definitions.

A profile declares WHAT its workbook contains (datasets, fields, stable
canonical ids, validation rules, exports) plus one adapter that reads the
profile's persisted domain tables into `RawRecord`s. Everything else —
cell validation, review status, provenance defaults, outcome, QA summary,
generic exports — is shared engine code, so adding a profile (invoice@1,
purchase_order@1, …) is a registration, not a change to the engine or UI.
