"""The one way a document is deleted.

Deleting a document removes everything that belongs to it alone: its rows
in every table that references it — directly (document_id) or through one
of its own rows (a page's text blocks) — found from the schema's foreign
keys, so new tables are covered without changes here; then, once the
database transaction has committed, its stored file, any files derived
from it (normalized images, converted Office files) and the remote storage
object. Child documents (portfolio members) are detached, not deleted.
Shared reference data is never touched.

Authorization: `documents.delete` deletes any document; `documents.delete_own`
(the anonymous workspace role) only documents its own workspace uploaded.
A document the caller may not reach is reported as not found.
